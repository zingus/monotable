# Monotable

Monotable is a text-based file format to describe tables of data.

## File Format

An alternative to csv and markdown, it uses the indent of the labels of the
first line of the file to describe the column boundaries.

## Status

Right now it only features a simple parser for this format.

## To Do

Future expansions will allow, reading and writing, to and from an array, and
possibly csv and excel transcoding.
